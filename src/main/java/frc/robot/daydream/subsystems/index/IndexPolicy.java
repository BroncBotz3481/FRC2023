 * The Constants class provides a convenient place for teams to hold robot-wide numerical or boolean

 * globally (i.e. public static). Do not put anything functional in this class.
 *
 * <p>It is advised to statically import this class (or one of its inner classes) wherever the
 * constants are needed, to reduce verbosity.
